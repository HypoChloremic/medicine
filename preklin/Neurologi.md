## Visuella system
 
 1. aqueous humor gets replaces all the time. vitreous humor is never replaced. 
 2. the retina has rods (night vision) and cones (color)
 3. fovea is a concentraion of cones only. 1:1 coupling with the optic nerve so u get the absolute best situation, gives u the best resolution.
 4. vascular layer, fibrous layer, neural part

#### The lens
cornea and lens work together to focus images to the retina. 
refractive power RP: is much greater in cornea than in lens, which would imply that it does more. but the benefit of the lens is that it's adjustable. 
 
 
 
 
the lens and its adjustability
two parts to it: unaccomodated and accomodated (these terms are specific to the lens)
default, usual setting is unaccomodated. this is for far vision. the lens is flattened because muscle and fibers stretch it
 
 
 
contraction of the muscle makes the fibers loose and relaxation of the muscle makes the fibers stretched. 
 
 
 
if u shine light in one eye, both pupils get smaller. 
 
 
what happens is u shine light, activate optic nerve on one side, goes to an area in midbrain called pretectum, from there the information goes bilaterally to both edinger-westphal nuclei. key! so this information goes to both sides through CN III and both pupils get smaller. 
 
 
iris 
 
circular muscle, inner, contracts with bright light. radial muscle, outer, contract in dim light to make pupil larger. pupil can go 2-8 mm, normal about 6. 
circular muscle is parasympathic and radial are sympathic. 
 
 
retina
 
 
horizontal cells = lateral inhibition, means that things on the sides of a stong stimulus will be inhibited so we can pinpoint where exactly that stimulus came from. 
 
pigment epithelial cells furthest back
 
 
 
the optic disc is where the optic nerve is, blind spot
 
 
 
 
 
color vision: 
trichromatic vision
 
rods have ion channels that close when exposed to light, low neurotransmittor release. but in the dark it's high release. 
 
cis and trans:
the discs of the rods are rich in rhodopsin: retinol + opsin. without light, the retinol is in the cis form. when it's hit by light, the retinol changes to trans. this is the only light sensitive process in the system. 
lack of vitamin A gives night blindness. 
 
 
how can just one photon excite over 100 ion channels in a photoreceptor?
 
visual transduction process 
 
light hits the rhodopsin that goes fron cis to trans, which activtes a g-protein called transducin. the activated g-protein activates the enzyme phosphodiesterase, that will make cGMP -> GMP. the fall in cGMP causes the ion channels to close. 
 
regeneration of discs: 
with time the top of the rods break off  and that's gonna be phagocytozed by pigment epithelium cells. if this doesnt work then you get retinitis pigmentosa that gives loss of all peripheral sight becuase the rods are in the periphery and they will not work. 
 
adaptation
cones: fast
rods: slow
 
during the adaptation there's a synthesis of new rhodopsin. this is why rods can become more sensitive in the dark
 
takes 20-25 min. to get fully adapted to dark. increased sensitivity by 106. 
 
 
receptive fields. ganglion level.
 
the ganglion thing have a center and a surrond, these are antagonistic. on center or off center.
 
receptor fields of the ganglion cells are detecting contrasts, not the absolute level of illumination. 
 
 
 
 
 
intriducing the bipolar cell
 
center:
 
 
when bipolar cell detect a decreased signaling from the rod, it will disinhibit that negative input and in turn send positive information to the ganglial cell so we get a stimulus sent to the brain. 
 
the opposite is true when we have horizontal cells. they 
 
surround:
 
 
 
central visual pathways
 
Lateral Geniculate Nucleus 
Primary Visual Cortex (striate) 
Developmental Aspects
 
Lateral Geniculate Nucleus is a layered structure, 6 layers. innervation both ipsilateral and contralateral. 
layers 1 and 2 are magnocellular layers and the others are parvocellular. 
 
 
 
 
 
the first relay station from optic nerve. recieves both from left and right. 
 
primary visual cortex:
organized in a special way, in columns, alternating between left and right. these are called ocular dominance columns. and also divided into columns of orientation. 
 
the information is broken down to its elementary parts and then later it gets put together. 
 
after the visual cortex theres a dorsal and a ventral pathway. the dorsal is involved in motion, spacial vision. vetral is for object recognition and high resolution vision. 
dorsal is magnocellular and ventral parvoceullular. 

Sensoriska system
Perception: tactile senses, vision, hearing, smell, taste
many sensory systems give not rise to perceprion: pH, blood pressure, CO2, O2
 
 
receptor, sensory cell, commonly a neuron that has its cell bosy in the dorsal root ganglion. it's where the transduction takes place = converting stimulus to electical signal. 
 
types of sensory systems in terms of physical stimulus
	mechano receptor systems
	chemical
	light
	temperature
many work with ion channels and some are mediated through g-prot.
 
morphologies
 
	afferent neurons of the pseudo unipolar type
 
X--------------------------
 
some have accessory structures, like pacini
 
	special receptors, for example hair cells in the hearing system, rods in the retina, and others
 
Transduction process
 
stimulus -> electrical signal. for example channels that are sensitive to mechanical strech, if they get streched they open -> influx of Na -> potential
 
if the receptor potential is large enough u get an action potential, becasue even though the channels at the terminals are mechanosentitive the channels that convey the action potential (in the nodes of ranvier) are propably voltage gated, not that he said so, but i think he tried.
 
it's an amplitude modulated signal. higher stimulus -> higher amplitude of receptor potential -> higher frequency of action potentials (frequency modulated signal)
 
 
adaptation is that there is an intensity of the response despite a constant stimulation.  there are slowly adapting and rapidly adapting receptors. more rapidly adapting receptors will stop firing faster. CO2 receptors are very poor adaptors and continue firing for weeks.
 
 
receptive field: are where the receptor can be stimulated. if you have many neurons with small receptive fields, and these neurons synapse with the same spinal chord neuron, then the receptive field of the spinal chord neuron is the sum of the receptive fields of all the peripeheral neurons. 
 
there are both excitatory and inhibitatory parts of/around the receptive field
 
 
cutaneous systems (ch. 9 somatic sensory system). there are 3 main modalities, types of stimuli. 
	mechanical (pressure, touch, vibraion). axons usually Abeta type.
	temperature (heat, cold). axons usually Adelta and C, small
	pain
all these are pseudo unipolar
 
mechanical receptors:
meissner, adapt rapidly, superficial, small receptive fields, 40% of cutaneous receptors.
merkel, adapt slowly, small receptive fields, 25%
ruffini, adapt slowly, large receptive field, 20%
pacini, adapt extremly rapidly, 10-15%
(in head and lips there's an additional krause receptor)
important in hands maybe especially, becuase we do a lot of shit with our hands and feel many things. we can identify what we are feeling even if we don't see. 
 
 
 
 
two-point discrimination threshold:
 
 
depends on density of receptors. 
 
dermatomes have to do with receptive ranges. 
 
he thinks we should know t4 (nipples), t10 (umbilical), inguinal, 
 
 
temperature receptors:
not much to say sa han. but the axons have free nerve endings, whereas the mechanical receptors had accessory structures. 
 
 
här glömde jag lyssna, men:
 
 	 
	Mechanical senses via the dorsal column system (baksträngsbanan)
	The primary sens fibers from periph goes into the dorsal horn, then the axon continues up, in the dorsal part of the spinal chord, the drosal column, to the caudal medulla, where there are the cuneate nuclei and gracile nucleus. These nuclei make synaptic contact with a second neuron that crosses mdilne that go to the thalamus, making synaptic contact with a third neuron that than go to the sens cortex. There are three neurons in this mechanical system. (Vibration is used to determine if there are issues with this path); note the medial leminiscus. 
 
 
 
in the face we have n trigeminus, will for obvious reasons take a different path but will end up in the same place. 
 
mechanical stimuli: pressure, touch, vibration takes this path 
 
	spinothalamic system, anerolateral system (tract). for temperature and pain
 
mechanical stimuli will be conveyed ipsilaterally in the spinal chord whereas temp and pain is contralateral in the spinal chord 
 
primary sensory neuron goes in and makes contact with second neuron in the same segment, the second neuron = projection neuron. then to thalamus, 3rd neuron, cortex. 
 
 
 
 
sensory cortex is behing the central gyrus, 
 
shaped like a band. there are two areas, primary and secondary somatic sensory cortex. 
 
face and hands have large part of this area and trunk and legs a small are in the cortex. reflects importance of face (lips esp.) and hands for sensation. 
 
 
 
 
if you remove a finger, after some time the reprensatation of that finger is basically gone. 


Auditiva system
inner ear, vestibular and auditory parts. both have hair cells, stereocilia. 
 
 
outer ear:
ear canal, due to its lenght and width it has a certain resonance. the best resonance is about 4 kHz. 2-5 kHz. this is good for speech. a disadvantage is loud sounds in this frequency area, that become even louder and can be harmful. 
 
middle ear:
3 bones and 2 muscles. 
 
impedance, resistance. because you go from air to liquid inside the ear, 99.9% would be reflected away and only 0.1%  transmitted. there's a mechanism to compensate for this. two ways:
first is the contact area of tympanic membrane is 20x that of the oval window, so a large area is transmitted into a small area. the other way is the bones, that are organized to give maximun lever effect. this way, what you put in the ear you get in the cochlea. without that you'd only head 0.1%, so basically nothing.
 
otosclerosis is a disease of the middle ear, starts in or around stapes. calcium starts to build up around the bone until it can't move and then you can't hear. cure is to replace with plastic stapes. 
 
inner ear:
cochlea, fluid filled. 
we have scala media where the hair cells are. also scala vestibuli and tympani. 
endolymph is in the scala media and the other have perilymph. 
 
 
the endolmph has a high K+ concentration. the perilymph is low in K+. 
the yellow thing is the striae vascularis, highly vasculated and sensitive to stuffs like oxygen. 
 
the basilar membrane have a distribution of what frequency it responds best to. every place on the membrane has its own best frequency. tonotopically organized. base is higher, top is lower frequency. 
 
 
 
hair cells are also organized like that. 
 
the basilar membrane is more stiff at the base and less at the top. this is helping to segregate the different frequencies. the membrane is only fibers, nothing else. 
 
theres active and passive basilar membrane vibration. difference due to the outer hair cells. without them you get a smaller amplitude. when they get stimulated they change their size and add to the amplification. 
 
the outer hair cells amplify sounds, improve our sensitivity, imporves frequency selectivity, increases dynamic range. 
 
 
otoacoustic emissions are generated by the outer hair cells. because theres gonna be a lot of energy that has to be released somehow, 
 
stereocilia are the most weak and can be injured and die and then the cell dies to, for example after noise trauma. 
 
when you are in loud noise efferent nerves can get activated and inhibid outer hair cells
 
 
 
• Cochlear Nucleus 
• Superior Olivary Nucleus 
• Lateral Lemniscus 
• Inferior Colliculus 
• Medial Geniculate 
• Auditory Cortex
 
but shes only gonna highlight 1 and 2.
 
coclear nucleus have different cell types. it breaks down the elementary components. 
 
superior olivary nucleus has the first bilateral interaction
 
sound localization requires two ears.
 
the s.o.n. has two parts, lateral and medial. lateral does intensity differences and medial time difference. this needs two ears to know the difference between them to be able to localize sound. 
 
the primary auditory cortex is also tonotopically organized. 


Vestibular system
System
 
 	 
 
 
 	 
U got three organs:
	Saccule
	Utricle
	Three semicircular canals
 
Both utricle and saccule have hair cells embedded in a gelatinous membrane (similar to the tectorial membrane in the cochlear organ). On top of this we got otoliths that are Ca-Carbonate crystals on top of the membrane, putting a pressure on there. 
You got a membrane lying over the hair cells called the cupula, functionally the same, when the shit is pushed around the cupula will transmit the waves. 
 
Function
	Linear and rotational acceleration, the rotational is with the semicircular canal and the linear with the saccule. 
	With this you only want to know where you are in space. VIsual orientation via eye muscles.
	Control of posture
 
Structure
Only diff of cilia here is that they are much longer. They have a kinocilia too, the longest one is a kinocilia. 
 
Otolotihs are perfect hexagons, 
 
Uticle and saccule
 
 	 
 
A is hair cells at rest. There is a striola a little ridge in the middle of the structure. Looking at B and the line there is the striola, it is a boundary, because the orientation of the hair cells are different. The arrows are indicating the direction of excitation. Note the difference in directions between the saccule and the uticle. 
 
You are always comparing the datastreams between the elft and right side. 
 
Morphological polarization
Deflection of the kinocilia gives excitation. They are very well organized. During development when this has to be organized is amazing. 
 
With polariztion she means that a certain direction is needed for excitation and inhibition. 
 
Linear acceleration
 
 	 
 
 
The uticle is giving horizontal information, and the saccule vertical. 
Driving a car are acceleration detecters on the horizontal field. During the acceleration phase they are activated, once you reach a constant speed they stop sending signals. The tilt of the head back and forth is causing the shit to send signals. 
 
The saccule and the uticle require gravity. So if you have been in space then ocme back, their uticle and saccule wont have experienced alot of stimulus, once now they get overstimulation.  The second figure illustrates spontaneous activity of the otolith organs. 
 
Semicircular canals
 
 	 
 
 
 	 
 
Anterior, horizontal, posterior. 
Anterior: kullerbyttor (somersaults)
 
We know there is a cupula, once you start rotating there will be a flow that will deflect the sterocilia, or a cupular displacement, sending data. 
 
So when turning your head, to the right, you will have your right semicircular organ will stim, whereas the other one will be inhibited. 
 
You only will get stimulus during the acceleration phases. The acceleration will excite and the decelertion will be inhibiting. 
 
Note that the acceleration and the deceleration phases are different. 
 
Note the difference between the uticle and the saccule that when you have accelerated to a specific state you will maintain the stimulus or the frequency of action potentials for the duration of the tilt, until you decelerate and tilt back. On the other hand you will be having an acceleration then the stim going back to the normal noise. And then for the deceleration you will get a dent. 
 
 
Note that there is endolymph in the vestibular organs. 
 
If one wishes to test one side against the other, you will perform a caloric test. 
 
Nystagmus
 
When you stimulate the vestibular organs you will induce nystagmus, a moement of the e eyes, a slow movement to counteract the head movement (vestib system), and fast movement centrally controlled if there s a defect o one side the vestibular sustem you induce the nystagmus spontaneously. 
 
Vestibular ocular reflex
 
You are rotating your head in one direction and your vestibular induced movement is your moving your eyes in the opposite direction. What is makingthe nuystagmus, the oculomotor nucles is pulling on medial rectus and the abucens is activating the lateral rectus, between the medial and lateral rectus. 
 
The eye movements are driven by the abducens and the oculomotor, acting ao medial and lateral. Note here that the hair cells are organized in a mirrored fashion. 
 
Slow phase: semicircular
Fast: vestibular cns control
 
You always want to have a focus point
 
Two types nystagmus:
	Vestibular nystagmus: spontanceusos or induced, net differences n firing rates from left to right sides generate eye movement (more important)
	CNS driven (non vestibular): fixation (small rapid movements), or optokinetic (looking out the window of a train).
 
 
Connections between the vestibular system:
	Spinal cord: alpha and gamma moror neurons controlling extensor muscles
	Cranial nerves for modulating eye movements
	Cerebral ctx for motor output
	Cerebellyum for vestibular afferent innervation
	Reticular fomration, sensory and motor functions
	Autonomic ststem with sweating and vomiting. 
 
Losing balance with alcohol: changing the densities of the endolymph, a little dilution will affect. There is also a central component. 
 
 
 
A combo between the cochlear and the uticle and saccule. 
 
 
Summary
Morphological differences between the saccule and the uticle. They have otocona (otoliths). The semicircular hvae the cupula the little cover.
 
Uticle horizontal linear acceleration.
Saccule vertical linear acceleration. (elevators)
 
Always opposite between the different sides.. This is related to the mirrored conditions
 
Caloric test to measure one side vs other. 
 
Note that the vestibular is connected to many parts of the brain making it susceptible to many different disorders. 
 
There are tip-links in the vestibular system as well. 
 
The excitatory direction is always from the short cilia to the longest, in that direction. 
 
 
Luktsinne
odorants bind to receptor, signal goes back through nerve fiber, through cribriform plate, go to glomerulus. here we are starting to sort and organize. then it signals to the dendrites of the mitral cell. 
 
 
the cilia of the olfactory cells are in the mucous layer. 
 
the cilia will start the transduction, results in influx of Ca2+ and efflux of Cl-. 
 
this is the same for att receptor cells. 
 
there's one cell that have one gene that will produce one receptor. one cell = one type of receptor. 
 
these can react to several related molecules.
 
3% of our genes are for coding odorant receptors. cray. 
 
 
the periglomerular and granule cells do inhibition to sharpen the signal. 
 
the glomeruli in the olfactory bulb will identify different odors. one glomeruli is responsible for several odors.
 
combinatorial code for odors. a means to explain how we can recognize different odors. 
 
 
 
concentration of molecule can change what we smell.
 
the L and D type of a molecule can smell entierly different.
 
areas in the brain that respont to smell are, like taste, not organized in a nice pattern but rather into pleasant/unpleasant.
 
 
 
smell is coupled with memory, much more strongly than sight or hearing. and also much more emotional. 
 
also related strongly to sexual behavior. in animal tests if you remove some of the g-prot receptors they alter their sexual behavior. 
 
odors are processed by differnt cues. for the olfactory system, vanilla. the trigeminal system, irritants like acetone, alcohol. pheromones are odors that are released by one individual and affect the behaviour of another individual. 
 
animals are absolutely reactin to pheromones, because theres a vomeronasal organ (different from olfactory system) and if that is cut they will never mate. 
in humans it's unclear, we can't really see that organ, so it's unclear if we actually react to pheromones, but we still probably do, but how is unclear, but maybe we do it through some other receptors. 
 
human pheromones are produce in sweat, urine, vaginal secret. for women the perception depends on sex homone status. it's higher at ovulation, lower during menstruation. 
 
 
 
 
 
Misc
 
Learning outcomes:
The student shall:
 
Be able to describe the nervous system’s macroscopic anatomy including identifying major core areas and pathways (S2)
 
Major regioner av CNS inkluderar:
	Telencephalon
	Temporal lobe
	Occipital lobe
	Frontal lobe
	Parietal lobe
	Diencephalon
	Thalamus
	Hypothalamus
	Hjärnstammen
	Cerebellum (lillhjärnan)
	Ryggmärgen
 
Telencephalon
When regarding the telencephalon the most striking features that are noticed include those of the gyri and the sulci that characterize the brain. If you then take a closer look at how the cortex looks, you will notice that there are regions where the histologic layers are six (neocortex), and other regions with fewer layers (paleocortex).
 
Cortex cerebri
Can be dvidided into primary areas and areas of association. The primary areas seem to be directly linked to the outside world by way of somatosensory pathways, e.g. the eyes, mechano-sensory nerves etc. Further, the remaining areas of the brain can then be classified as association areas. The association areas seem to be involved with processing the sensoriy information being bussed into the brain, creating perceptive experievnes etc. Consequently it is possible to assign the association areas the more complex and less defined functions and interactions of the brain. 
 
Neocortex
This part of the cerebral cortex is the largest, and include 
 
As noticed, one can see that there are multiple different layers with different neurons.
	Pyramidal cell (1-3)
	Stellate cell (4)
	Dendrites (5)
	Descending axon (6)
 
Paleocortex
Is a "phylogenetically" older part of the cortex. Located around the parahippocampal gyrus, medial and inferior of the temporal lobe. 
 
Archicortex
Is a part of the cortex with even fewer layers. Occurs in the hippocampus and the pyriform cortex. 
 
Anatomical divisions
 
 
	Forntallobe
	Personality
	Short term memory
	Formation of speech
	Parietallobe
	Attention (e.g. attention to the left and right part of the visual fields). 
	It is important to take note of the asymmetry when regarding attention, involving the visual sensation: the right parietal lobe is much more heavility involved when we regard the visual shit, as it seems to be integrating more of the info than what the left does. If u then were to lose the shit on the left parietal lobe u wouldnt sustain to bad shit regarding attention. (Note figure 26.6)
	Primary somatic sensory cortex Broddmann's areas 3a, 3b, 1 and 2 located in the postcentral gyrus. 
	Temporallobe
	Image recognition (object recognition). Objects that we see or we hear. 
	Hence when the temporal lobe sustains damage, difficulties associated with recognizing objects appears, which is a condition generally called agnosia. 
	Occipitallobe
	Primary visual cortex is located here. The association areas are involved in processing the visual information, (do note that this data is bussed around the brain for processing). 
 
 
Subcortical nuclei
By nuclei, we assume that the literature refers to groupings of cells with a specific niche.
It is possible to narrow these down to specific regions of the brain
 
 
Globus pallidus aint vsibile. 	 
Nucleus caudatus looks different dependent upon the section. 
 
 	 
 
 
 
Telencephalon
	Basal ganglia; has three different nuclei
	(Striatum)
	Nucleus caudatus
	Putamen
	Globus pallidus
It seems that the nucleus caudatus and the putamen are both grouped together, becuase these are functionally similar. Thus together, these are called the striatum. With regard to functionaliyty, they are very much involved with motor control, thinking and parts of the basal ganglia is involved with emotions. Fig 16.1 in Neuro claims that the basal ganglia are very much involved with gating the proper initiation of movement. 
 
Upper motor neurons are neurons situated in the cerebral cortex, sending their axons down to the lower motor neurons. However, understand that the lower motor neurons are also innervated by local circuit neurons, that receive input from upstream. According to the illustration atleast we see that the basal ganglia gate the initation of movement. 
 
Diencephalon
Thalamus 
Is a part of the midbrain, or the diencephalon. It is located slightly medially to the basal ganglia. 
Comprised of 50 different nuclei that communicates sensory and motor info to the cortex. The thalamus is essential to the brain, 
 
Hypothalamus
Incorporated into the endocrine system of the body, by simply regarding the portal-vein system with the pituitary gland, and the hypothalamus, in addition to the regulatory hormones (e.g. GHRH, GRH, CRH, dopamine)
 
Limbic system
Be aware of the inaccuracy of the term that is the "limbic system". Instead of refering to the system, one refers to the specific anatomical parts, however, this was presented anyway. The limbic system seems to incorporate a number of structures, but looks like an arch in the medial part of the temporal cortex, in addition to a number of other structures. 
 
 	 
 
 
 	 
 
A number of stuff is associated to the limbic system:
 
Emotion
	Ant part. 
	(Prefront cortex)
	Cingulate gyrus (gyrus cinguli)
	Amygdala
	Green nucleus illustrated is in the amgydala
	Parts of the basal ganglia
	Thalamus
	Mediodorsal 
 
Memory
The blue parts as illustrated. 
	Hippocampus
	Fornix 
	Corpus mammilare
	Located inferior to the thalamus and directly inferior to the third ventricle.  
There are two types of memory that were mentioned during the lecture:
	Declarative memory: kind of memory that can be taught by communicating them in a language. 
	Non-declarative memory: kind of memory that can not be taugh by communication, such as the way in which to swim. 
The cortex, cerebellum and parts of the basal ganglia are involved with both of these memory kinds. 
 
 
Spinal chord
Alternatively the medulla oblongata. 
 
 	 
 
 
 	 
Reticular formation is a term that one will come across, and refers to the various interconnected nuclei in the brain stem. They can go from the upper parts of the midbrain to the lower parts of the spinal chord. It runs along the midline. 
Two parts:
	Reticular ascending system
	Consciousness
	Reticular descending system
	Posture..
 
Dopaminergic system
There are two systems or groupings, that are dopaminergic. Both of these regions are associated with the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area
	Mesolimbic system; in the ventral tegmental area (VTA)
	Motivation
	Reward
	In the case of activities eliciting reward it is this part that transmits dopamine. 
	Especially linked to the medial prefrontal cortex.
	The mesolimbic system is activated in conjunction with the consumption of various drugs and shit. 
	Nigostriatal system (substantia nigra..)
	Motor function
	Send projections to the striatum
	Hit in Parkinson's disease and are therefore associated with the kinetic consequences of the disease (e.g. motor initation and modulation)
These have projections to the cortex, subcortical nuclei and striatum. 
 
 
Serotonergic systems
Associated with the Raphe nuclei in the mesencephalon. Projections seem to reach all over the brain, to the cerebellum, the thalamus, the cerebral cortex and even the ventricles..
Involved with a number of functions:
	Mood
	Hunger-satiety regulation
	Motor functions
	Temp reg
 
Summing
	Formatio reticularis: consciousness, motor function
	Dopamine: motivation, reward, motor
	Serotonin: mood, hunger-satiety, motor
	Misc: resp, swallow, cardiovasc reg
	Cranial nerves: sens and motor. 
 
Cerebellum
Clump located behind pons. Rly linked to pons. 
Macroanatomically it has folia which are in essence the gyri but in the cerebellum. 
 
Functional division
 
	Spinocerebellum
	Middle of the flattened projection of the cerebellum
	Input from spinal chord
	Fine-tunes movements: arms, legs, trunk
	i.e. It is involved with feed-back systems that correct the genereal innaccuracies of the motor behaviour generated by other parts of the brain. 
	Cerbrocerebellum
	Lateral parts
	Input from telencephalon
	Linked to more complex movements (eg speech)
	Twisted Insane has a well-dev cerebrocerebellum
	Vestibulocerebellum
	Flocculus and the nodulus. 
	Input from vestibular nuclei, that are receiving data from the vestibular organs, telling the position of the head. 
 
Peduncles
 
 	 	 
 
Note that these connections, containing tens of millions of axons represent the thickest paths of axons in the CNS. 
The connection between the cerebellum and the rest of the NS is mediated cia three peduncles:
	Superior cerebellar peduncle (brachium conjunctivum): efferent path
	Neurons using this path are in deep cerebellar nuclei, projecting their axons to the upper motor neurons, and after relay in the thalamus to the primary motor areas of the cortex. 
	Middle cerebellar peduncle (brachium pontis): afferent pathway to the cerebellum
	These cells projecting are the contralateral pons, forming pontine nuclei, the input of which are from all over the place, such as cerebral cortex and sup colliculus. 
	Inferior cerebellar peduncle: aff and eff paths. 
	Aff from vestibular nuclei in spinal cord, and diff places in the tegmentum (between ventricular system, distinct basal and ventral structures; involved in homeostatic stuff, that is ofc uncoscious; it covers the ventral part of the brainstem)
	Eff go to the vestibular nuclei and reticular formation (i.e. The abovememntioned dopaminergic and serotinergic paths..)
 Looking at fig 19.1 one notices that the peduncles are located away from the midline, which is the reason that in medial sections, one only sees the ventricals projecting down where one thinks that the peduncles should be. 
 
 
Spinal Cord
 
 	 
 
 
Characteristics
There are several important aspects that need to be considered when looking at the spinal chord:
Grey matter	Central, has a dorsal and a ventral horn
Horns	In the horns, one can find particular synapses for particular systems, two of which will be mentioned below. 
White matter 	Peripheral, and leads a high concentration of axons runing caudally or rostrally or laterally. 
Paths	Knowing where specific paths run in the white matter of the spinal cord is important to relate loss of function with specific lesions. 
 
Sensory pathways
There are two sets of pathways that sensory systems employ:
Dorsal-column-leminiscal system;
This syste, carries information from mechanoreceptors that for instance exist in the skin. The system is characterized by three neurons:
	The receptive neuron, the soma of which resides in the dorsal root ganglion. Inside the spinal cord, the axon this neuron sends will go along either the gracile (lower body) or the cuneate (upper) tract to reach the gracile or the cuneate nucleus, where there are synapses with second neurons
	The second neuron sends internal arcuate fibers, that have crossed the midline and run contralaterally, up to the thalamus where they synapse in the ventral-post-lateral thalamus nucleus. 
	The third neuron goes to the sensory cortex for processing. 	 
 
Spinothalamic system (alt anterolateral system)
There are three neurons involved here too.
	The first receptor neuron will synapse very early on in the dorsal horn.
	Second neuron immediately cross the midline and travel up to the thalamus, to the ventral-posterior-lateral thalamic nucleus
	The third neuron will go to the primary somatic sensory ctx. 
 
The conclusions that can be drawn when looking at the pathways is that one may get asymmetric loss of function dependent upon where the lesion has appeared. 

If the lesion appears in the primary sensory ctx, the contralateral pain, temp and mechanic sensation will be lost. 

However, if the injury is caudal, in the gracile and cuneate tract including the path of the pain/temp afferent fibers, then we will be getting an asymmetric pattern, where ipslateral mechanic sensation is lost, and contralateral pain/temp sensation is lost for a specific region. 	 
 
 
If we were to look at the face, then we would note that there are slight differences, because we are instead involving the trigeminal nerve that carries the data streams instead.
The only main difference really is that for mechanic sensation, the synapse will occur immediately after entry of the axon into the spinal cord, and then the crossing of the midline, otherwise highly similar. 
 
Primary sensory ctx
In the ctx, there is a somatotopic organization. 
 
Corticospinal tract
This is a pathway that goes from the ctx and leads to motor neurons and interneurons controlling motor functions, in the spinal cord. 
Integration of datastreams	The motor cortex integrates a great number of data streams.  
	Basal ganglia
	Relayed via ventrolateral thalamus
	Cerebellum
	Relayed via ventrolateral thalamus
	Parietal lobe sensory regions
Location	Precentral gyrus and paracentral lobule
A central characteristic of the primary motor cortex as compared to "premotor areas" of the cortex is that they:
	Require low electrical external stimulation to elicit a motor response, implying the presence of a direct path to the lower motor neurons
	Can be cytoarchitecturally distinguished from the other regions suggesting the earlier too. 
 
Now the different cells that are considered to be upper motor neurons has been widely discussed according to Purves, where it was previously considered that "Betz" cells that are maybe the largest neurons in the body, were classed as such. However, due to these cells only account for 5% of the axons running to the lower motor neurons, the pyramidaly cells of layer 5 in the motor cortex represent the upper motor neurons. 
 
Data bout the corticospinal tract	 
 	 
 
 
Be able to describe blood supply to the brain and fluid circulation (S2)
 
Ventricular system
 
 	 
 
When regarding the fluid circulation it is important to remind ourselves of the ventricular system of the brain.
The ventricular system consists of several ventricles:
	Righ/Left: 
	ventral-laterally u find the basal ganglia and the
	Dorsally: corpus callosum
	Medially: septum pellucidum (it is a midline membraneous tissue)
	3d 
	4th 
 
Present in each ventricle is a choroid plexus that produces cerebrospinal fluid that fills the ventricles. CSF reaches the subarachnoid space via perforations in the thin walled 4th ventricle. The CSF is via arachnoid villi dorsal-midline returned to the venous circulation. Note that the arachnoid villi extend into the sagittal sinus, allowing their drainage. 
 
Embryologically, the ventricles are derived from the lumen of the neural tube 
 
The flow
CSF from the lateral ventricles flow through interventricular foramina to the third ventricle, between the right-left diencephalon. From the third ventricle there is a connection to the the fourth ventricle via the cerebreal aquaduct. In turn, the fourth ventrical, where we find the cerebellum dorsally, can form the central canal in the spinal chord, that will not remain patent (visible) postnatally. 
 
Data
Volume: ~140mL
Turnover: 500mL per day
 
Hydrocephalus is thus related to the obstruction of flow of csf. 
 
Blood supply 
The supply of blood to the brain is critical. There are several improtant arteries involved in this system:
	A carotis interna
	A vertebralis
	A basilaris
Both of these artiris form together circulus willisi
	Feeds to A cerebri anterior
	A cerebrii media
	A cerebrii posterior
The cerebral arteries feed different areas of the cerebral cortex.
 
 
Be able to describe the development of the nervous system from ectoderm to mature nervous 
system (S2, S3)
 
There are a number of aspects to be considered regarding the development of the nervous system: 
	Neurons
	Glial cells
	Astrocytes: important for synapse formation, and synaptic func
	Microglia: are involved in cell-death
	Satellite cells
	Schwann cells
	Oligodendrocytes
	Microanatomic structures (such as the different nuclei)
	Macroanatomic structures (including the various extoderms and the like.)
 
Two developmental stages are to be considered: gastrulation and neurulation. 
 
Gastrulation
15th day
During gastrulation a number of important structures are formed: 
	The primitive pit
	The primitive streak
	Germ layers: 
	Ectoderm
	Mesoderm
	Endoderm
Gastrulation takes place in the third week. Before the epiblastic cells start to migrate, the buccopharyngeal and the cloacal membrane, with the primitive streak and the primitive pit forming, whereas these cells start to migrate. 
Instead of two layers (epiblast (från embryoblast) och hypoblast), three are created, by having
The epiblast cells thus become endodermal cells, before being followed by additional cells that become mesodermal cells and finally the remaining layer has a name-change to ectoderm. This is gastrulation (taking place day 15). 
 
-18th day
In order to form the different asymmetrical structures, it is necessary that the embryo possesses something that can maintain a directional gradient, which in this case would include the notochord, which is formed from mesoderm. The notochord that migrates rostrally from the primitive pit. Influencing the ectodermal cells lying above, the notochord releases different morphogens that the ectoderm reacts to, differentiating into neuroectodermal cells, that start to form the neural tube. 
Morphogens that the notochord releases at this stage is:
	FBGF
And thus on the 18th day we got the neural plate with the neigbouring ectoderm. 
Note regarding neuroectodermal cells:
	Become neural precursor cells (later, it can be read that neural precursor cells include the astrocytes and the oligodendroglia).
	Do not differentiate into glial cells. 
 
20th day
We begin to fold the neural plate. Structures that begin to appear:
	Neural groove
	Floor plate
	Notochord (already present)
	Pre-somitic mesoderm
 
22nd day
What is intereesting at this point is that the neural tube is now complete, having successfully fused the neural groove, via the apical actinfilament bundles that together started to contract by virtue of myosin. 
 
There are two structures that act in a similar fashion as the notochord, by providing with different morphogens, namely the floor and roofplate (the floorplate predates the roofplate that is put in place once the neural neural tube has been formed and the groove is fused).
 
Present structures at this stage:
	Neural crest cells
	Neural tube
	Roofplafe
	Floor plate
	Notochord
	Somites
 
 
Factors involved in the development of the neurologic structs
	Retinoic acid
	Of the steroid form and can thus pass the lipid bilayer and easily reach the cytosol where it binds to a vit A bidning protein, before it moves on into the nucleus where it further binds to proteins regulating gene expression 
	Retinoic acid is important for the creation of the neural tube
	Floor plate and notochord
	BMP - bone morphogenic protein (belongs to the Transforming Growth Factor family, ie the TGF family). 
	 Peptide kind and binds to serine kinase that phosphorylates intracellular proteins giving rise to a cascade that alters gene expression. 
	Induces differentiation and is involved with stopping the fusion of the neural groove (and is thus related to spina bifida, caused by a dissatisfied folic acid concentrations in the body, which induces the formation of noggin which inhibits BMP by binding to it). 
	"specification of the neural plate"
	"dorsal spinal cord and hindbrain diff"
	If there is unabated FGF and BMP signalling which can occur when one inhibits the inhibition via noggin of BMP, one induces a highly proliferative state that can lead to the formation of another head or spinal cord for instance. 
	FGF
	Peptide kind and therefore also binds to membrane receptors, of the tyrosine kinase kind, employing a similar way of action as does the 
	SHH - sonic hedgehog
	Protein kind binding to some weird receptor proteins, or surface proteins on the lipid bilayer. 
	Determines the neuron identity in the ventral parts of the spinal cord and hindbrain.  It also seems to be involved with the differentiation of other types of neurons, such as interneurons, sensory and motor neurons.  
	Notochord releases shh
	Dysfunction can lead to holoencephaly or medulloblastoma 
	Wnt
	Also a protein that signals via a surface protein or rather receptor inducing some form a cascade resulting with some kind of transcription factor activation. 
	Establishes anterior and posterior polarities. 
	Prompts the formation of important organs as well. 
 
 
 
Subcategorizing	 
BMPs, FGFs, Shh, Wnts, RA		Establish basic body axis
	Identity neural crest
	Fates of classes of cells
	Cellular differentiation
24th day
The nervous systems' major elements are being put in place. 
	Sensory ganglia (assumedly put in place by the neural crest cells, that will eventually form the dorsal root ganglia). 
	It is the anterior ends of the neural plate (neural folds) grow at the midline, cont to expand giving rise to the brain. 
 
Second and third trimesters (and earlier)
Early on, we note that after successfully fusing the neural tube, it will commence to bend, forming the provided shapes, with:
	the spinal cord most caudally, followed by 
	Rhombencephalon
	Mesencephalon and the
	Prosencephalon
These different parts are in turn characterized by lateral buds, that in fact are the spinal and cranial ganglia. 
Note the cervical and cephalic flexure.
 	 
 
Continuing down the dev scheme we continue to fold the tube, and elaborate the structure:
	Spinal cord - cental canal
	Myelencephalon - 4th ventricle
	Metencephalon - 4th ventricle
	Mesencephalon - future cerebral aqueduct
	Diencephalon - 3d ventricle
	Telencephalon - 3d ventricle
Ofcourse, one major question which arises is in what manner the cavity of the neural tube is maintained, because such a cavity is, one would believe, not present in the CNS later on postnatally. The answer lies with the presence of different parts of the opening, illustrated in the above list. 
 
Note the pontine flexure that marks the end of the myelencephalon and the beginnning of the metencephalon. 	 
 
Finally in the third trimester, the placement of new structures will have terminated, and instead the expansive phase of the present structures commence:
	Spinal cord - Spinal cord
	Medulla - Myelencephalon
	Pons - Metencephalon
	Cerebellum - Metencephalon
	Midbrain (s/i coll) - Mesencephalon
	Hypothalamus - Diencephalon
	Dorsal thalamus - Diencephalon
	Hippocampus - Telencephalon 
	Basal ganglia - Telencephalon
	Olfactory bulb - Telencephaln
	Basal forebrain - Telencephalon
	Cerebral ctx - Telencephalon
 	 
 
Notes	Supposedly, mesencephalon does not follow all the rules regarding BMP and FGF. 
 
Programming the setup
Making segmentation possible in addition to the following complexities, are genes that encode tf, and that in turn are up and down regulated in accordance to a segmentation process themselves: sequential gene expression is the term of this process. In accordance to previous notes on the subject, this is possible by using morphogens that are produced and released with a spatial and temporal organization, which provide the possible different concentration gradients required to activate the different hox genes:
	Ret acid - ant/post
	Shh - dors/ventr
 
Differentiation of neurons and glia
Neural precursors	Recall that the notochord induces a subset of the neuroectodermal cells to differentiate to neural precursors. In turn the neural precursor cells are stem cells that can develop into:
	Neurons
	Astrocytes
	Oligodendrocytes 
In accordance to its stem cell abilities, the neural precursor can undergo proliferative mitosis without the need to differentiate. 
Location	Several locations attributed to the neural precursor:
	Ventricular zone
Neuroblasts	Differentiated from neural precursor and sets the cell to develop into a neuron. 
Division	The neural precursor cell can undergo two kinds of divisions. Early on, the neural precursor cell will exist between the pial surface (the external environment, the amnion) and the ventricle (neural tube lumen), and it will be attached to both surfaces with extensions. It has been discovered that the nucleus of the precursor cell migrates closer to either region in different stages of the cell cycle:
	G1: ventricular surface
	S: pial surface
	G2: ventricular surface
	Mitosis: ventricular surface
	Asymmetric: produces a progenitor and a neuroblast
	Symmetric: produces two precursors
	Either new extension to the pial surface if precursor and enter resting phase, or not. 
Symmetric division	Produces more neural precursor cells, and takes place horizontally, in the same plane as the existing precursor cell. 
Asymmetric division	Takes place in the vertical plane and produces a progenitor and a neuroblast. 
Notch	Transmembrane protein, that can bind to a membrane boumd receptor on a different cell. The cell projecting the notch protein (notch cell) and the cell that possesses the receptor (delta cell) act differently. When notch is cleaved IC, it will release a factor that will affect gene expression, which will eventually prevent the cell from becoming a neuron. 
Notch will affect the expression of bHLH genes. These genes are supposedly involved in glial and neuronal differentiation, 
 
 
 
 
Migration	It is to be noted that in specific regions of the developing nervous system it has been found that there are radial and tangential migration patterns, that have lately been refuted somewhat, by virtue of tracing cells with markers and following their migration. 
Transmitters	One can also look at the transmitter specific neuronal development
GABAergic neurons	Supposedly developed in the ganglionic eminence
Glutaminergic neurons	Developed in the pallium. Associated somehow with the basal ganglia
 
Subdivisions
The cortex is subdivided by virtue of the involvement of signalling via:
	BMP
	Wnt
	FGF
	Shh
For instance, looking at the developing neocortex with its 6 layers, it has been established that it is developed in an inside out fashion, where the oldest cells are located in the innermost layers, whereas newly generated cells migate from the ventricular zones, radially through the developed layers to the zone of interest. 
 
Be able to describe the principles that control axon growth and the synapse formation
(S2, S3)
 
The growing axon has a growth cone which directs the axon towards an area characterized by a specific environment. According to lecture notes, the growth cone contaisn lamellipodium and filipodia. Note that the lamellipodium seem to be much wider than the filopodium. What is to be noted is that there are f-actin (filamentous actin) that can dynamically change its position in space by virtue of polymerization and depolymerization, in addition to microtubules that provides the entire enteprise with a robustness.  
 
Proteins
Note the great number of proteins required for functionality:
	
Integrin receptors 		Are very important adhesive proteins that can bind to a number of things both extra and intracellularly. 
	The integrins can bind to the extracellular matrix, the ecm. 
	Role-wise, the integrin receptors can initiate signalling cascades that lead to some effect within the neuron. 
Contact mediated growth		Attractive: a neuron in contact with these molecules, it will stimulate growth, once it is in contact with it, such as a surface. 
	Repulsive:
 
Molecules that contain these kinds of signals include:
	Laminin-integrin
	Fibronectin-integrin
	Cadherins-cadherins
	Ephrins-eph receptor
 
Chemically directed growth	Via chemotropins - diffusible
	Chemoattraction
	Chemorepulsion 
A great number of molecules belong in both categories:
	Netril
	Slit
	Semophorin
	Nogo 
Example 
Developing spinal cord can involve chemically induced growth
Involved chemotropins are slit and netril.
	
Netril: 	Production: lower medial cord;
Slit: 	Production: bottom cord
Process	The axon is first attracted by netril, moving toward the lower midline, where the concentration is highest. At the same time the concetration of slit is increasing too. Once the concentration of slit is high enough it will turn off the attraction to netril and at the same time make slit repulsant, which allows the axon to grow in the opposite direction and cross the midline. 
Note	We see that the previous history of the neuron, axon or growth cone is imp. 
 
Furthermore, it sems that these proteins are also improtant to allow fasciculation, where axons (plural) grow together. 
 
Mechanisms
	
Tropism	Chemoattraction and repulsion
Trophism	The survival of the neuron 
	Neurotrophic factors: NGF; considered as target derived trophic factors.
Experiments where one has dramatically increased the neurotrophic factor conc in solution has led to a higher survival rate. On the other hand an inhbiition of NGF  is related to the increased death of neurons. 
 	A combination of both of these factors guide the neuron and eventually allow it to survive. For instance before limb development, an overproliferation of soma are takes place, whereas only those that reach the limb will survive due to the trophic factors that it will receive in that situation. Otherwise, these neurons die. 
 
Neurotrophic receptors
	
The Trk receptors	These receptors respond to neurotrophic factors
Trk A 		Induces cell death unless stim by NGF
	PNS
	Dependence receptor
 
Trk B		Doesnt induce cell death
	CNS
	Involved in cell differentiation
	Stim axon growth and dendrites
	Synaptic plasticity
Trk C		Induces cell death unless NT3 (neurotrophic factor 3)
	PNS
	Dependence receptor
Note	The experiment where they did a knockout of this shit seemed only relatable to the PNS
 
Formation of a synapse
Adhesion stage	Cadherins attach boudon to dendritic spine. Related fam is protocadherins
Induction stage	Factors that bind together inducing cascades on either side:
	Neurexin (pre) - neuroligin (post)
	Syncam (pre) - syncam (post)
	Epherin B (pre) - eph B receptor (post)
Vesicles and protens accumulate 
Maturation stage	Presyn: 
	active zone (dense thickening of membrane)
	Synaptic vesicles
Postsyn:
	Postsynaptic density, corresponding thickening.

Be able to describe and explain the passive properties of nerve cells and understand how they affect incoming signals (S3, S4) Be able to describe the active properties of nerve cells and the most important function of ion channels (S3, S4)
 
Before mentioning that, we should look at the different types of neurons that exist:
	
Unipolar	These cells have one long axon extending from the soma. Also called pseudounipolar. 
Multipolar	Several axons
Bipolar 	One axon and one "dendron." We note that the bipolar cells may possess a big network of dendrites that feed into a dendron. 
Pseudo-unipolar	A previously bipolar cell that became unipolar. That grew an extension it seems, where they allow the afferent fiber the axon and the dendron to be one unit, permitting easier conduction.. There is are no dendrites in this case, but instead just one long axon. 
	Further divisions one can provide the following
	
Interneurons	Integrate shit, vast majority of neurons, elaborate structures
 
Components associated with the neurons
	
Neurofilaments:	 gives neuron immense strength, permitting it to survive joint traversal
Microtubule:	 allows for transportation, and can change shape
Actin:	 strucs close to the membrane
Boudons: 	divisions and thickenings from the axon, permitting synapses. 
Spines:	 on dendrites one can find these spoines permitting synapse formation. 
Nissle substance: 	(very pronounced) ER of neuron, due to high protein synthesis. 
Axon hillock: 	beginning of the axon, and before we get the initial segment. 
Initial segment: 	thin part of the early axon integrates data. 
 
 
Ion channels
	
Leaky channels 	The leaky channels are an essential part of the neuron, because these in essence maintain the resting membrane potential of the cell. There is a high perm for K and lower for Na, thus making the cell a bit hyperpolarized, where we get negative membrane pot. The eq pot of K, with regard to the concentration differences is about -90mV, whereas for Na is +55mV, implying that the driving potential for Na is very high which balances against the dominance of the K leaky channels.
Voltage gated channels	These channels change conformation as a response to a change in membrane potential, which in turn influences some charged amino-acids present in the protein structure.  
 
Ion channels in general	The channels is formed by the combination of a number of domains that form a transmembrane structure and an extramembrane structure that together form a channel that only allow specific ions to pass:
	Outer helix: In order to successfully form a transmembrane protein that forms a channel, it is important for the ion channel to possess a hydrophilic core permitting the passage of charged components, such as ions, it is important to have a lipophilic structure that cements the channel in the membrane, which would be a lipophilic helix
	Inner helix: The inner helix will form the walls of the pore through which the selected ions will be permitted passage. 
	Pore helix: Seems to play a role in the inwardly-rectifying channels
	Selectivity filter: the critical part of the ion channel, where a specific combination of amino-acids will form an opening with specific spatial and electrostatic properties that would only permit a specific ion through, eliminating its water shell, whereas for other ions not the same treatment would be received. Glutamin-tyr-glutamin
	Cytoplasmic pore: Seems to be the part of the ion channel that is in the cytoplasm. 
	Water-filled cavity: An enlarged cavity within the ion channels where ions can either attain a new shell or relieve themselves of their current shell in order to pass the selectivity filter. 
	Alpha-helix: this secondary protein structure is essential in forming an ion channel, as these are highly efficient in traversing the membrane, alt in forming transmembrane structure. 
Genetically 	The genes encoding the ion channel can come from 4-1 genes, where we get 4-1 subunits. 
Ion selectivity	For effective ion selection, two factors are important:
	Diameter of ion
	Electrostatic interaction between the ion and the selectivity filter 
Directions	Note that the channel is bidirectional, at it doesnt matter whether the channel is flipped for an ion to pass in a specific direction, but the ions can pass in both directions, and it is the electrochemical driving force instead that determines the direction of flux. 
Na channel	Has two beta subunits and one alpha subunit that is constituted by four domains all containing one alpha helix that is the voltage sensing part, 
Voltage gating	The gating mechanism is based upon the twisting of an a-helix due to the change in votlage. 
 
Electrochemical gradient	Is dependent upon the membrane potential, the equilibrium potential, and the difference in concentration of an ion on each side of the barrier in quetion, which in this case is the lipid bilayer, the cell membrane. 
Electrochemical driving force	In order to make shitty ions flow in whatever direction, one needs a(n) (electrochemical) driving force. In order to produe this driving force, there needs to be an electrochemical gradient. 
 
Studies where one increased alot the concentration of K outside the cell showed that the resting membrane potential would follow a positive linear relationship with high enough increases of K concentrations, wheras at lower concentrations, a non-linear relationship would follow, which is due to the existing permeability to Na, influencing the resting membrane potential, and due to the hi driving force of Na at low membrane potentials. 
Equilibrium potential	As described by Nernst: 
 
 So the equilibrium potential incorporates the cocentration gradient it seems. So once u have reached Ek = 0, there is no concentration gradient, however, an electrical gradient might remain which can then be described by: 
I=g\ \ast(Vm\ -Ep), in effect we are looking at the driving force or in essence the voltage that will drive the endeavour, whereas the ion flux flow that follows. 
Conductence	All channels have an internal resistance, that can be described as: \frac{1}{R}=gx.
 
Types of ion channels	There are a number of ion channels that differ in properties and purpose
Gated	Open or close in response to stimuli, where the transition = gating.
	Ligand-gated: possess a receptor (can both be inside or outside). Ligand-binding leads to the channel opening. 
	Phosphorylation-gated: synaptic transmission with 2nd messengers, involving kinases and phosphorylases. 
	Voltage-gated: voltage dependent
	Stretch/pressure-gated: stretch dependent; 
Examples		Ca, K, Cl, Na channels
	Glutamate: Na in, K out. (mostly Na in)
	GABA: Cl ions
	K channel, Ca activated: K out
	Cyclic nucleotide channel: Na in K out.
Non-gated	They are always open, they leak, they maintain the membrane potential. (It seems that these do not involve that sodium-potassium pumps). However, I would concur and in fact involve the sodum-potassium pumps. 
Examples		K inward rectifiers
 
Misc	 
Receptor potentiation	The passive membrane potential produced in the receptor that may elicit, 
Spatial summation	Involves EPSP's, where the summation of these in terms of the passive membrane properties of the cell, will in case of reaching a threshold in question lead to the the release of an action potential. 
 
Ion channel properties	There are different properties characterizing different ion channels
Voltage gating	Taking a voltage gated Na channel as an example, it can exist in three different states:
	Closed: at this stage the voltage channel has incapacitated the channel itself, not permitting ions to pass. And this is voltage dependent and can change to an open state when the voltage thresh is reached. 
	Open: in this state, the ion channel permits ions to flux through its pore, however, this ahas already initiated the next state which is the inactivation.
	Inactive: the inactive state can occur when the channel is already closed or when the channel is open, and is temporally constant as long as it has been started, which can be due to a low voltage increase from the closed state, or the fact that we have reached the open state, and the voltage is on long enough. If we on the other hand, for some reason kill the voltage immediately after opening, then it would be possible for the thingy to close without inactivating, but this does not occur in physiological conditions due to the really hi driving force for Na. 
It is important to note the triangular relationship here, 
Desentisization	This occurs after overactivating some channel, and leads to an internalization of the channel, not permitting, leading to a lessened response to the same stimulus, even if the stimulus is high. 
 
 
Study methods	Many different ways to study ion channels
Voltage clamp		Measure current membrane potentia
	Compare to command potential
	Change the membrane potential to the desired one
	Measure the ion flux as a result of the command potential, indicating ion channel function. 
Patch clamp		Glass pipett, find membrane patch
	Apply suction, relieving the cell of some membrane and the desired channel
	Now you can use different concentrations of shit to measure the effects of ion flux.
You can make the pipett:
	Continous with membrane: you remove some membrane, allowing you to measure the entire thing. 
	Inside-out: you just detach some membrane with the channel
	Outside-out: you flip the membrane and thus flip the channel.
 
Passive membrane prop	The membranes of different cells can be characterized by different properties, which would be dependent upon the membrane composition, the diameter of the extension in question etc....
Time constant \tau	Looking at a specific point A on an axon's membrane (ie not intricate membrane structure), and where the membrane is uniformly charged, the derivation of this constant tells us that the membrane is charged like a capacitor, where the membrane voltage slowly rises in accordance to depolarizing current. 
 
The time it takes for the steady state value of the voltage divided by the voltage response reaches 67%, and after it has reached 100% the decline to 37% is the same time constant. 
 
\tau=r\ast c where tau is the time constant, r is the resistance of the membrane, and c is the capacitance of the membrane. Larger axons with large diameters have low resistance and higher capacitance whereas the opposite for small axons, and small axons tend to have longer time constants! 
Length constant \lambda	The length constant is looking at the length from point of current injection to the point where 37% of Vm0  at point A.
\lambda=\frac{\sqrt{rm}}{r0+ri} where rm is the resistance of the membrane, ro is the resistance of the extracellular medium and ri the resistance of the axoplasm medium. Thus high membrane resistances are attributed to long length constants. This in turn is related to small axons that have bigger membrane resistances.  
EPSP	 
IPSP	 
 
Action potential	The action potential is the way data is conveyed is transmitted in the nervous system (in addition to the abovementioned passive membrane properties)
Stages		Resting state
	Depolarization
	Hyperpolarization
	Afterhyperpolarization
	Slow afterhyperpolarization
	Refractory period
Resting state	The resting state of the neuron, in this case, is maintained by leaky channels for Na and K, where the permeability for K is higher than that for Na. The leakiness thus produces the resting state, where these also play a role in returning the mmebrane potential to the original potential during repolarization after afterhyperpolarization. 
  Important ion channels:
	K Inward rectifiers
	Na leaky channels
  According to a summary 20:1 for A:B
Depolarization	When the membrane potential reaches a threshold of some -40mV, or roundabout, we activate the voltage gated Na and K channels. However, a critical difference is that the K channels are characterized by delaying their opening after threshold reach, permitting the really high driving force of Na to depolarize the membrane, reaching the eq potential of the Na channel (note that the driving force of Na decreases with depolarization, due to the progression to its eq pot).
 
Repolarization and Hyperpolarization	As the Na channels can be inactivated due to prolonged stimulation, the depolarization will summit will start to decrease because the Na channels have entered inactivity, timed with the opening of the K channels that now have a huge driving force for their ions, noting that the permeability for Na has disspiated away. Thus the membrane potential is driven downwards. It is worth mentioning that calcium channels are also opened during the hyperpolarization period. 
  Once the threshold for the opening the ion channels has been passed during the hyperpolarization the K channels will with a delay close, which permits the membrane potential to reach so close to the eq potential of the K channels.  
  Note that we have opened calcium channels during the hyperpolarization too.  
After-hyperpolarization	Influx of Ca may aid in depolarization, however this may activate the next stage
Slow After-hyperpolarization	After the hyperpolarization, and if the IC calcium concentration is high enough, we will get an activation of Ca activated K channels, that will once again let K into the cell, hyperpolarizing it. Note that with freq ap's we can induce a situation where the cell has accumulated calcium, due to the slow expulsion of calcium which in turn activates these channels, hyperpolarizing the cell once again. This seems to be some form of desensitization involved. 
Other terms	Absolute refractory period is when the Na channels are inactivated, whereas the relative refractory period talks about the closed K channels due to hyperpolarization, and we are getting a restoration to the resting membrane potential.
  The inward rectifiers seem to be activated once we reach hyperpolarization, which permits this restoration.  
Na-K-ATPase	Are involved in the long run maintenance of the resting membrane potential.

Be able to describe the presynaptic mechanism for  transmitter release and the main classes of transmitters (S3, S4)
Conditions	There are a number of conditions that a transmitter needs to fulfill to attain that title
	Accumulated in presynaptic vesicle
	Released bvo calcium influxed thro depolarization
	Induce electric response postsynaptically 
Small-molecule transmitters	Produced in the presynapse. Packaged in vesicles in the presynapse. 
Includes:
	Biogenic amines
	Serotonin, histamine
	Cathecolamines
	Aminoacids: GABA, glycine, glutamate
	Purines: ATP
 
Production	There are enzymes in the presynaptic terminal that use precursors so as to produce the desired transmitter
Packaging	Vesicle that has been reformed from the presynaptic membrane employing clathrin coating, also carries ATPases that pump protons into the vesicle, lowering the pH, subsequently using the gradient in transporters transporting in the transmitter. 
Release	Lies close to the active zone of the 
Neuropeptides	These follow the transcription-translation process produced in the RER, transported via the golgi apparatus, and sent in vesicles with kinein on microtubules to the presynaptic terminal. 
Function	Because the neuropeptides are contained in large dense cored vesicles, they will be released in response to high freq stimulation of the presynapse, which elicits an accumulation of calcium. This in turn can act to inhibit the classsical neurotransmitter effect, representing some form of desentisization. 
Range	Of effect is wide for neuropeptides, and can therefore reach several synapses. 
Inactivation	Neurotransmitter inactivation is essential in order to prevent overstimulation. 
Acetylcholine	The inactivation of acetylcholine occurs via acetylcholinesterase, wherer the ester bond of acetylcholine is broken by an enzyme in the synaptic cleft. 
  Products are acetate and choline, where the latter is retransported via Na/choline transporters. Acetate is transferred to choline via acetyl-CoA. 
Receptor	Lets in both Na and K, can let in Ca in some cases. Two acetylcholine can bind to the receptor
Glutamate	Is inactivated by transport into a glial cell that uses glutamine synthetase, where the glutamine is transported back to the presynapse, where glutaminase is employed. The glutamate can ofcourse be involved in other processes as well. 
Receptor	AMPA or NMDA. 
GABA	Transported either to glial or presynapse, where it will not be transferred back from the glial cell. In the presynapse it can either be broken down, or directly go to being transported into new vesicles. Decarboxylated glutamate produces GABA too.  
Receptor	GABA-A and GABA-B
 
 
Transmitter release	There are several stages to transmitter release that need to be considered
Transmitter loading	The vesicle needs to be filled with the goods
Docking	By virtue of the SNARE proteins present on the vesicle, the vesicle can by virtue of T and V-SNAREs bind to the presynaptic membrane, and be primed for fusion.
	V-SNARE = synaptobrevin
	T-SNARE = syntaxin + SNAP25  
Priming	Complexin comes in and stabilizes the SNARE proteins, whereas when Ca is introduces, synaptotagmin replaces the compelxin and induces SNARE complex formation. 
Recycling	Untwisting the SNARE via SNAP that binds NSF to the complex. 
NSF is an ATPase, separating the SNARE proteins, using ATP.
After they will clathrin cage, dynamin helps it bud off the membrane.  
 
Be able to describe different types of postsynaptic receptors and signal transduction mechanisms (S3, S4) Be able to describe and explain the properties of the synapses and their importance for information management in the  CNS (S3)
 
Ligand gated channels	These channels:
	Multimeric
	TM with a-helices, ie the usual stuff 
Ionotropic 	Are ligand-gated ion channels
NMDA	Na and Ca. 
AMPA	Na and K
Kainate	Na and K
GABA-A	Cl; binds 2 neurotransmitters
Glycine receptor	Cl
Nicotinergic receptor	Na and K
Metabotropic	The metabotropic receptor is not necessarily linked to an ion channel, ie it does not mean that it is a ligand-gated ion channel in any way
mGluR	Rects to glutamate, which in turn will lead to the activtation of phospholipase C, releasing IP3 and DAG, where the DAGactivates PKC, which is coactivated by calcium that is incr by both release from ER and the climbing fiber release calcium, stimmed by depolarization. 
GABA-B	K
Muscarinic receptor	Varies regarding ion flux
Almost all other biogenic amines	 
 
 
Synaptic plasticity	The ability to change the reactivity of a synapse, as a response to the previous history of the synapse and the neuron, with regard to data streams
LTP	Long term potentiation, where the involvement of the NMDA receptors are essential. Note when the postsynapse both receives glutamate and a sufficient depolarization will the Mg be eliminated and the NMDA will be opened. This explains why neurons active synapses on a neuron, that upstream have a different synapse with very strong activation which would elicit LTP there, will also experience an LTP themselves. 
Early LTP	A long term potentiation that comes in the form of increased amount of for instance AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. 
Late LTP	Is more complex and involves transcription factors and the like, such as CREB and pka etc, which could involve the growth of the synapse. 
LTD	 
Internalization	Of AMPA receptors, seems to be clathrin dependent.
Internalization seems to be a part of desentisization.  
 
 
Have knowledge of methods used to register activity in individual nerve cells and groups of nerve cells (S1)
 
Voltage and the patch clamp, in addition to inserting an electrode in the cell, near the membrane atleast.

The student shall:
	Be able to describe the anatomy and the cellular structure of the sensory organs (S2). For example, the student shall be able to describe the structure of a retina.
	Be able to describe and explain how receptor cells recode incoming sensory signals  (mechanical stimuli, light, sound, odour molecules etc.) to neuronal signals that are 
communicated to the brain (S2, S3, S4). 
 
Vestibular system
Organs
	Uticle: contain the macula which has hair cells and supporting cells to the hair cells (in the same layer). In turn, the hair cells are embedded in the otolith membrane which is a gelatinous layer on top of which we find the otoconia, which are heavy causing a greater influence by gravity on the otolith membrane, affecting the sterocilia and the kinocilia as well on the hair cells to be displaced more dramataically due to movement. This is also the main cause to the saccule and the uticle not being activated during presence in zero-g environments. A streak along the structure called the striola demarcates the polarization of the hair cells, where on the opposing sides the cells will have opposing polarizations, whereas a tilt along the axis of teh striola, will lead to opposing responsens by the opposing sides; When
	Oriented horizontally
	
Note that it is the gravitational force greatly affecting the otoconia attached to the otolith membrane that displaces the layer, whereas the attached stereocilia follow the tilt	 
 
	Not only are tilts affecting the otolith membrane, but also transient movements, such as acceleration in a car and acceleration in an elevator, where the otolith membrane can be affected by the forces involved. 
	  During linear acceleratio and deceleration we will also have a transient (temporary) excitation and inhibition of the uticle and saccule, whereas tilting will be a tonic stimulation. 
	
Saccule;	 the striola oriented vertically
Semicircular canals		The hair cells are present in the ampulla in this organ, where the hair cells are capsulated in a cupula, and where the cellbodies are almost in a layer of cells called crista layer. 
	Crista: sensory epithelium. The cell 
Nystagmus
There is a vestibulo-ocular reflex that is activated when the head is rotated. The organs involved in circular motions are the semicircular canals: 
	Ant: around x (frontal)
	Post: around z (horizontal)
	Horizontal: around y (longitudinal)
Say we are rotating our head from the left to the right. The horizontal semicircular canals on both sides will then produce different responses, where the right canal will increase its firing rate (in the direction of the motion) and the left one will decrease its firing rate. We are to note that there is a spontaneous activity involved here, where during acceleration we get an increased acitvity, and when we reach a steady state of speed we go down to the level of the spontaneous activity, whereas deceleration is the opposite. 
 
The resultant signals are integrated (note that we are for instance involving the oculomotor nerve and the abducens nerve to induce the vestibular nystagmus and the non-vestibular nystagmus), leading to:
	 a vestibular nystagmus which allows your eyes to maintain foveal focus on the same point despite rotation of the head
	Non-vestibular which involves the CNS allowing the eyes to rapidly move to find new foveal points in the direction of the motion, centering them in the orbital cavity. 	 
 
More on nystagmus:
	Vestib nyst (slow eye movement)
	Cns: fixation and optokinetic
Saccade
The saccade seems to be a CNS induced motor response in the eyes that not necessarily involves the vestibular system. One can for instance have saccades to  points of interest in the visual field, which we will cover a bit later on. Instead note that the oculo-vestibular reflex involes a slow movement in the opposite direction of te angular rotation, in order to automatically maintain foveal focus. However, once the slow movement is no longer suffient, because the point is now out of the visual field, we need a new point which is produced by a saccade that is centrally induced by the CNS, involving the geniculates it seems. 	 
Caloric test
Warming the ear, will incr firing rate in the canal in question, whereas not freezing the ear will decr firing in q. Thus warming one ear, will induce slow movement toward the other ear, ie the opposite direction, because the system believes that you are rotating towards the warmed ear in question, whereas you have saccades to the warmed side, remember COWS (cold oppositem warm same). 
  In this ay one can identify lesions in different parts of the brainstem or conduction path. 	 
 
 
 
Mechanic stimulation
A number of skin receptors that react to different kind of mechanic stimuli:
Merkel	Texture	slow	They all seem to use ABeta afferent fibers, that are relatively large, and have pretty fast conduction speeds up to 75 ms. Dia of axon is 6-12 micons.
Meissner	Motion	rapid	 
Pacini	Vibration	rapid	 
Ruffini	Stretch	slow	 
 
Two-pt discrim is important for diagnosing the progression of diabetes in distal limbs, in addition to evaluating peripheral neurogenic problems, which includes for instance the carpal-tunnel syndrome. 
 
Path	The path that this afference takes is critical to remember, when later regarding different injuries. 
Dorsal root	No synapeses present here.
Dorsal column system	Via cuneate or gracilian tract.(dorsal column medial leminiscal path)
Caudal medulla	Cuneate and gracilian nucleus
Medial leminiscus	To the thalamus
Primary Sensory ctx	The data bus is integrated. 
 
 
 
Proprioception
For proprioceptive feedback, there is a different system at place. 
Substantia grisea	Proprioception synapses all over the place in the same level, however there is a part that ascends
Dorsal column	Seems to take the same general path as the mechanoceptive tracts.
Clarke's nucleus	No crossing the midline, and occurs in the proximal dorsal horn
Spino-cerebellar tract	Remember the no crossing the midline, but then continuing in an ascending fashion, to the cerebellum, and dorsal column nuclei. The tract is in the dorsolateral substantia alba. 
 
 
Nociception
Or nociception, is conducted through C or Adelta fibers. Where the C ones are the unmyelinated ones, considered free nerve endings. 
\delta
 
Dorsal horn	Synapse
Anterolateral tract	Cross the midline
Thalamus	Synapse in the thalamus
Primary sens ctx	Integration of data bus. 
 
Cross-communication
There is a cross-communication between the mechaniceptive tracts and the nociceptive tracts, where mechanic sensation synapses on inhibitory neurons that are activated, this inhibiting the nociceptive information being sent from a particular area. 
 
Allow us to go deeper into pain rather
Pains	Different kinds of pains:
	Nociceptive
	Neuropathic
	Idiopathic: no apparent neurobio basis: whiplash, fibromyalgia
	Psychogenic 
Placebo	Seen to be inhibited when opioid receptors where blocked. 
Free nerve endings	Seem to be in the epidermis. 
Axon reflex	Branches of peripheral afferents, in addition to spinal cord neurons can release neuropeptides as response to high stim, that in turn is proinflammatory. A neurogenic inflammation
Dorsal horn cells	 
Nociceptive	Alpha delta, loc pain, fast, lamina 1, small rec field
Polymodal	C fiber, lamina 1, slow, big rec field, 
Wide dyn range	Diffuse loc pain, intestines, joints, big rec fields, lamina 5, nociceptive and non-noc
Lissauers tract	Tip of dorsal horn seen along the spinal cord up and down, where afferent fibers dont need to synapse in spec segment of entry but caudal or rostrally. 
Axon reflex	This is related to the release of neuropeptides from a primary afferent for instance, that leads to an increased inflammatory response, where the substance P can stim mast cells or neutrophils to release histamines, or to influence blood vessels to leak etc. 
 
 
CNS	There are two main connections or linkages that the pain system makes, that one should take note of:
	Sensory-discriminative 
	 Affective-motivational
Sensory-discriminative	This takes a look at the localisation of the pain, where it is etc. 
	Anterolateral syst
	Ventral post nuc (thal?)
	Primary sensory ctx
Affective-motivational	Is a system involved in the emotional aspect of pain. 
 
	Anterolateral sys
	Lots
	Amygdala
	Hypothalamus
	Peri acuqductal grey
	Ret formation
	And midline thal nuc
	To ant cing ctx
	Or insular ctx
 
Transduction	There is a heavy involvement of G-protein coupling when looking at endocannabinoids, opoids and na, or bradykinin, prostaglandin,
 
	Gprot coup
	Bradykinin
	Prosta glandin
	Op, cann, norep, go to K channels ie inhib
	These either influence TRPV1 that lets in cations (nonselective)
	TrkA
	NGF
	Leads to trpv1
	Ionotropic
	ATP
	Voltage
NAV	Family of Na channels that different afferent neurons can be characterized by. 
Mutations		Inactivation of the gene, NAV1.7 leads to no peripheral sensation
	Erytromelalgi: hyperactivity, burning sensation, blushing. 
TRP	These are involved in cold sensation, in identifying pH, and different chemicals etc, can be related to cold hyperalgesia and the like.
 
Non selective ion channels 
Receptors		Primary afferents: sub P (NK1 rec, gprot) and glutamate (AMPA and NMDA)
	Interneurons: enkephalins, GABA, glycine
	Descending paths: Serotonin (both via diff receptors), norepineph (inhib via alfa 2)
 
 
Glial cells and neurons	Dependent upon the frequency and subsequent transmitter release and the like, we note that there will be differeing concentrations of glutamate and sub P in the cleft, leading to different reactions in postsynapse and the glia, ie astrocytes and microglia
Weak	When there are low frequencies and Ap, where there are low glutamate over the synapse, we note that the postsynapse will not react considerably
Stronk reaction	We get sensitization due to the inflammatory shit that is released as aresult of the increased glutamate combined with sub P as well. 
Proinflam	There may be cytokines and inflam factors
Antiinflam	Also release of IL4 and 10, incr cannabinoid rec, inc TNFalpha that hinders glutamate toxicity, and astrocytes clear the neurons that are dead, preventing inflam from spreading. 
 
Referred pain	We get convergence via symp system were afferents and symp system afferents it seems converge on one dorsal horn neuron, where these will integrate the response, usual for skin cells and GI and the like. 
 
Vision
Structures
A number of structures are critical to know in the eye:
	Vascular tunic
	Iris
	Ciliary body
	Choroid: blood supply
	Fibrous tunic
	Cornea
	Sclera
	Neural tunic (retina)
	Neural part
	Pigmented part
	Optic disc: nerve and veins leave, artery enters
	Macula: characterized by the highest visual acuity and contains xanthophyll that protects against ultraviolett waves. 
	Fovea
Iris
Iris har radial muscles and circular muscle: when the radial contract the pupil enlarges, when the circular contract the pupill gets smaller. 
	Smaller: para
	Larger: symp (superior cervical ganglion?)
 
Retina
Several kinds of cells, in the periphery we have rods towards the fovea we have cones. 
	Pigment epithelial cells 
	Cone/rod
	Horizontal cell
	Bipolar cell
	Amacrine cell
	Ganglion cell
 
Both the cones and the rods have an inner and an outer segment, which containts the region with rhodopsin. In the outer segment of the rods we find discs, carrying rhodopsin with retinal which is the light sensitive part of the structure going from cis to trans (just like the best way it sounds) when light-stimulated.
 
Transduction occurs when the retinal is changes enantiomer form, thereby changing the protein rhodopsin, which activates transducin, which is a g rotein taht in turn activates PDE, a phosphodiesterase that breaks down cGMP, that in turn will turn off Na channels in the lipid bilayer, leading to a hyperpolarization of the membrane. Worth to note that this signal is in turn reversed by the bipolar neuronal cell,  	 
 
The fovea is free from rods, and has an indentation that may also aid in visual acuity. 
 
Analyzing the distribution of the cells, it becomes apparent that in the periphery, the rods dominate, whereas closer to the fovea, we find a population dominated by cone cells. 
 
Contributing to the visual acuity is the 1:1 ratio between the cones and the optic nerve fiber connections in the fovea. 	 
 
 
 
The deal with contrast and bipolar cells
 
We are now discussing on and off center  and not surround. Before we start it is important to note that when a cone or a rod cell is stumulated with light we get a hyperpolarization of the cell, which is a signal we would like to transmit. I.e. When we get light we lessen the amount of glutamate that is transmitted in the synapse. By having a metatropic channel (in this case a g protein coupled receptor) we can inhibit depolarization, meaning influx of sodium when the glutamate concentration is high in the synapse (meaning we have no light), and stimulate depolarization, i.e. Stim the g protein receptor which is no longer inhibited by the glutamate, to open Na channels when there is no glutamate in the synapse (ie light shines on the rod or the cone). This way we invert the signal coming from the photoreceptros (of whose signals were relatively speaking already inverted?). For off-center bipolar cells we have AMPA receptors that get stimmed by high glutamate concentrations therefore depolarizing the cell, which occurs in no light-stimulation condition. 	 
 
Lateral inhibition
It is with lateral inhibition that we can have inverted surround receptive fields, that when we stimulate the on-center or on-surround, we laterally inhbit the neighbouring center or surround with a horizontal cell. The horizontal cell influences the cellbody of the photoreceptor, by depolarizing it, which in turn means that the light signal was lost.
 
After inquiry it seems that the situation is a bit more complex. The horizontal cell is stimulated by the release of glutamate (when there is no light activity). In turn the depolarization of the horizontal cell will lead to release of GABA onto the photoreceptor membrane, which in turn hyperpolarizes, meaning an enhancement of the light-response. 
 
In the case of an on-center off-surround. When we have light on center, the lessened release of glutamate from the on-center receptor will inhibit the surround cells (but this wont have any effect really, because the surround cells are not getting any light anyway), which in turn means that the center receptor is allowed to send its signal to the bipolar cell. However, if both the off-surround and the on-center were getting light, the horizontal cell would lessen the release of GABA onto the center-photoreceptor, which depolarizes it and therefore prevents it from sending its signal to the bipolar cell, therefore laterally inhibiting it. It is in this process that we get contrast data streams, instead of intensity data streams!

	Hypothalamus (reg of circadian rythm)
	Pretectum (reflex control)
	Superior colliculus (orient heand and eye movements)
	Lateral geniculate nucleus
	Layered. Ipslateral: 2+3=5. 
	1-2 have magnocellular layer, large cell, big dendritic net, large receptive fields, motion detection (transient responses), no color data
	3-6: Parvocellular: small cells, less dendritic net, visual acuity (sustained responses to stim), color data
	Optic radiation to
	Striate cortex
	Primary visual cortex
	Ocular dominance columns (right-left-right...): data from eye spec regions
	Orientation columns: orientation of objects. This is now two dimensional where dominance on one axis and the orientation on the other.
	Amygdala: for the fast reaction response. 
 
If we were to kill one of the columns, we would have plasticity, the other regions grow into the dead one, whereas the previous ability to handle that specifc dataset will be lost. 
 
Beyond the striate ctx there are visual areas organized into paths:
	Dorsal pathway
	parietal
	Motion an
	Spatioanl vi
	magnocellular
	Ventral pathway
	temporal
	Object recognition (shape, color, texture)
	High res vis.
	parvocellular
 
Cochlear
Impedene matching	Due to the change in phases from air to lymph, or rather water in the cochlea, lots of the energy that is transmitted would be lost if mere vibrations were in doing the work. Instead we have to influences:
	Area: the malleus to stapes is a concentration of 20:1 area effect, implying we are concentrating our energy into a smaller space.
	Lever effect: by virte of having organized the bones in different angles, we can increase the lever effect upon the oval window, permitting the vibrations to be transmitted with greater effect.   
Resonsance	Note that meatus acusticus externa has a resonant frequency, where the frequency being transmitted resonates best at around dialogue freq, which is between 1kHz and 8 kHz. 
Stria vascularis	Seem to be lining the walls of the scala media, and is highly vascular, in addition to producing the endlymph. 
Hair cells	The hair cells posess sterocilia, 
Tonotopic organization	There is a tonotopic organization to the basilar membrane, thus the hair cells, furthermore the nerve cells are also tonotopically organized. Cortical tonotopic organization exists also. 
Basilar membrane and frequency tuning	The basilar membrane is a fiber matrix that transmits waves as a result of the oval window being moved. As the basilar membrane is narrower and more stiff in the base and wider and less stiff in the apex, a tonotopic organization of resonant frequencies has been provided, which in turn is detected by the hair cells, by virtue of the increased movement of the basilar membrane which together with the tectorial membrane produces a shearing stress that the stereocilia react to. 
Sterocilia stimulation	In the basilar membrane's upward phase, the sterocilia will be jerked off center, toward the external hair cells, which in turn will lead to the tiplinks being stretched opening K channels letting K in, depolarizing the cell, that is then transmitted to the auditory nerves. 
Kinicilium	Is present in mammals, but disappears after birth (seems to be more of a thing in the vestibular organs). 
Amplification by hair cell called otoacoustic emission	The hair cells are able to auto-produce sounds, or rather amplify the waves stimulating them. I assume that when the hair cells are stimulated, opening the channels there will be additional movement produced by the hair cells themselves, similar to cardiac musce cells for instance.
  Related to the immense amount of energy produced in the stimulation process, that needs to be released somehow, coming in the form of vibrations produced by these hair cells. 
    After further inquiry, it seems that it is the outer hair cells that can be stimulated to contract, which in turn affects the stiffness of the basilar membrane, which explains its non-linear vibration, according to Purves. We have ie the involvement of the hair cells to sharpen the sounds recorded.
  Signal cancellation	Note that the upward-phase excites the cells more than what the down-ward phase inhibits them, thus not killing the produced depolarizations supposedly. 
Transduction process		Glutaminergic hair cells. Synapse on nerve cell. 
Efference to hair cells	Seem to be efference to the outer hair cells from the superior olive, or rather the CNS. 
Inner hair cells	These are the sensory cells, that actually send the sensory information to the CNS, almost 95% of the data comes from this subpop.
Outer hair cells	Have efferent nerves terminating on them instead, and seem to be involved in sharpening the frequencies. Seems that when the efference is active, you inhibit the outer hair cells. 
 
When one studies the tonotopic organization of the auditory system, one should care to note that along the way, the data is split up in different bits, to identify different aspects of them
Cochlear nucleus	This nucleus has several different cells, where the auditory nerve's data is split up, where specific aspects are identifued, for instance the onset, 
Superior olivary complex	Bilateral interaction.
	Lateral sup oliv: intensity differences
	Medial sup oliv: time differences. 
Inf coll	Whether it comes from front or back. 
Auditry ctx	Seems to be close to the insular ctx, int it is in sulcus lateralis.

Periglomerular cells	Laterally inhibiting the signals in the glomeruli
Granule cells	Inhibitory interneurons.
Signal sharpening	By virtue of the granule and periglomerular cells, we get a sharpening of the signals from the olfactory cells, sharpening the odorant pattern that is produced
Odorant pattern	One cell one receptor, that can bind different odorants with different affinities, where the odorants also can bind to different receptors. Thus providing an odorant, will produce an odorant pattern that is then relayed to the CNS

Be able to describe the functional principles behind the balance control system (S2-S3).
 
Tasks	The postural ctrl sys has several tasks:
	Center of mass within base support
	Ctrl of body and head
	Ctrl durin movement (inte and ext coordinate system) 
Coordinate system	There are two different coordinate systems relevant for postural ctrl and balance:
	Internal
	Proprioception: state in motion
	Sensation: joint, muscle, skin receptors
	External 
	Vestib
	Vis
Postural ctrl	Deals with the control of two types of movements:
	Primary
	The movement of the thing that will perform an action
	Associated 
	Permitting the above movement are associated movements made to keep the posture and balance. E.g. swaying arms when walking to maintain center of mass within base support. 
Paths	There are two major pathways for postural control:
	Vestibulospinal path
	From lateral and medial vestib nuclei (post pons?)
	To spinal cord motor neurons it seems
	ventromedial
	Reticulospinal path 
	From pontine reticular formation
	To motor neurons in the spinal cord
	ventromedial
Sensory systems	There is a number of sensory systems that feed to the vestibular control.
	Vision is for instance central one should note.  
 
Postural synergi	Preferred activation of pattern for muscle co-activation, ie several muscles, to maintain balance. 
Two strats for post ctrl		Anticipatory
	When you anticipate the consequences and start to activate postural synergies as a response in anticipation of the event.
	Feed back control
	Based upon the somatosensorial feedback received, the body will does shit. 
 
Head	Or the eyes rather, seem to be very important to keep on the horizontal. There are two main mechanisms involved in producing this effect:
	Tonic neck reflexes: many muscle spindles in the neck, provides lots of proprioceptive feedback, allowing the more precise neck control both reflex wise and descending ways
	Vetibular reflexes: stabilize pos of head with gravity.  
Be able to describe the location and main function of differentcorticalmotor areas (S2) and escribe and analyse the areas’ respectiveroles with different types of cortical controlled movements (S3-S4).

Be able to describe the basal ganglions and their mutual connections and connections to other parts of the CNS (S2). Be able to relate this knowledge to and describe the function of the basal ganglions in motor control (S3S4).
 
Be able to describe the differenttypes of eye movement and their general function, and explain the underlying functional mechanisms, particularlyrelating to saccadiceye movements (S2-S3).
 
Types of eye-movements	There are five types:
	Keep fovea on target:
	Saccades
	Smooth pursuit
	Vergence
	Stabilize eye when moving head
	Vestibulo-ocular movements
	optokinetics 
Keep fovea on target	 
Saccade	Visual feedback?
Moves object into the fovea fast by moving eye 
Smooth pursuit	Visual feedback
U got a slowly moving target, movements of the eye that keeps fovea on target, no fast movements.  
Vergence	Visual feedback
Moving eyes, such that objects at spec distance is in fovea, no duplication of the image, cuz the image is on the corresponding place in both sides.  
Stab eye when ctrl gaze	Stabilize eyes relative to external world, compensating for head movements.
Vestibulo-ocular movement	Need visual cues or feedback to keep this active. If the vestib system either is presented with slow movements or u have persistent continous movement, but with closed eyes, no reflex movements will take place. 
When head moves, want to keep the initial object in fovea, move eyes in the opposite direction of head rotation (nystagmus...).
 
Optokinetic movements	Say you got the entire visual fields moves, eg u sit in front of a tv screen and the visual field there states to move in the horizontal direction. Here we got a visual cue, no vestibular input, what happens is that you get optokinetic-nystagmus, where u get slow-pursuit of point, then when it is outside vis field it saccade to a new point...
  However, note that this system is pretty slow, with only relying on visual feedback and not vestibular feedback.
 
Motor neurons	The motor neurons involved in the control of the muscls are located in the brainstem. 
Abducens	Nucleus abducens is in pons. 
Trochlea	Nucleus trochlearis in caudal midbrain. 
Oculomotoris	Nucleus oculomotoris in midbrain. 
Control	There are different types of control that can be employed, regarding contraction of different muscles, with regard to different directions
Velocity control	If we take the lateral rectus, controlled by the oculomotor neurons, these need to produce a fast succession of high freq of Ap's to produce a fast movement. Hence we got a velocity control
Position control	If we have reached a specific position of the eyes, then to maintain that position will require tonic activity, there is a situation where these muscles dont need to fire etc. So an extreme contraction of a muscle and keep eye in that pos, u need high tonic activity. 
Inducing the control	In order to induce the necessary control, we will be employing difeferent mechanisms dependent upon what movement we are doing. 
 
Saccades	Two paths from the frontal eye field: 
	Direct
	Frontal eye field
	Cross midline inferior to inf colliculus
	Pons (PPRF the horizontal gaze center, in the posterior part) (paramedian pontine reticular formation) 
	Indirect
	Frontal eye field
	Superior colliculus
	Cross the midline where inf to inf coll
	PPRF
Thro these two paths we get a control of saccades. 
 
Subsequently, from the PPRF, the horizontal gaze center (ie ctrl lateral and medial rectus) we do either of the following; if we wish to move the eye on one direction in the horizontal field, we are forced to activate bilaterally either the lateral or medial dependent on the side at the same time, hence we need bilateral innervation:
	Turn eyes to the right
	From right PPRF
	To synapse in right abducens on the same level (pons)
	Bilateral innervation
	Abducens goes directly to right lateral
	Medial longitudla fasciulus goes up to the left oculomotor nucleus (midbrain)
	The left oculomotor goes to the left medial. 
Superior colliculus	The superior colliculus is retinotopically organized, where the retina and its recording of data spatially is mapped onto the superior colliculus. If you were thus to stimulate a part of the retina. 
Retinotopic organization	 
Sensory-motor regulation	In the superior colliculus u got a sensory layer that receives visual stimulus, and a motor layer, which then links to the horizontal and the vertical gaze centers in pons and the midbrain respectively, permitting the elicitation of a saccade to that point. 
Other modalities	Sup col receives aud and sens also, thus be able to saccade to those locations as well. 
 
	Express saccades: there is a linkage between the visual sens neurons in the sup coll and motor neurons that project and synapse on gaze centers, this path allows for the fast saccades when the vis field is stimulated. Because the sup coll also integrates other data, such as auditory and somato, it will be able to inhibit the vis field response etc. 
	Anti saccades: as the above last sentence talked bout, we can get express saccades, however integration of frontal eye field, ie ctx, permits more complex saccades, as in saccades in the dark and such. 
Frontal eye field	The involvement of the ctx allows higher order and more complex saccades, where u get anti-saccades, ie make urself get a saccade in the opposite direction. 
Distracting stimuli	In the frontal eye field, you can allow yourself to select for targets to elicit a saccade to, where similar stimuli but is considered a distraction will elicit a smaller response by the neurons (I assume some form of retinotopic organization of the frontal eye field), and the presence of lateral inhibition of some form, where the frontal field is looking for the target and suppresses the activity induced by other stuff in the visual field. 
Basal ganglia	Note that the basal ganglia, with striatum projecting to globus pallidus intern/sub nigra pars ret that project to sup coll and inhibit, however if activate direct pathway, u stop inhibiting it!

Be able in general to describe the cerebellum’s macroscopic and microscopic structure and its connection to other parts ofthe CNS and general role in motor activity (S2).  Be able to explainsynaptic connectionsinthecerebellumcortex and relate these to the function
of the cerebellum (S3-S4).
 
Structures	There are a number of important structures in the cerebellum
Hemispheres	Functions:
	Plan for future movements
	Coordinate movements 
Vermis	Functions:
	Integrate sensory data: 
	Proprioception
	Vision
	vestibular 
Flocculodularis	Functions:
	Balance.  
Degeneration	Fractionated movements, do not become as smooth and precise. Also prolonged reaction times
Organization	There is a somatotopic organization in the cortex of the cerebellum as well, which one should note. 
 
Cortical structures	There are a number of cortical structs in the cerebellum
Cerebrocerebellum	Goes to: 
	Dentate nucleus; a deep cerebellar nuclei
	Premotor
Involved in Planning
Spinocerebellum	Goes to:
	Fastigial and interposed nuclei
	Send to motor ctx and brainstem
Involved in Execution 
Vestibulocerebellum	Goes to:
	Vestibular nuclei (in pons)
	Brainstem and spinal cord
	Lower motor neuron
Involved in balance and vestibuloocular regulation 
 
Histology	A number of cells to take note of:
Layers	There are three main layers in the ctx:
	Molecular layer
	Purkinje layer
	Granule cell 
Purkinje	 
Granule cells	Produce the parallel fibers, are synapsed upon by mossy fibers
Climbing fibers	 
Mossy fibers	 
Stellate	Interneuron
basket	Interneuron
golgi	Interneuron
 
Encoding	The encoding of the cerebellum is highly interesting. We see lateral inhibition, and a nice system of kinases associated with LTDs also, by the internalization of AMPA receptors.
  What we note is that there is a tonic activity from the purkinje cells, and the deep nuclear cells. During movements, we however get changes in this activity. 
Loops	There are two main loops:
	Deep excitatory loop (shorter): this involves both the climbing and the mossy that send to deep cereb nuclei
	Cortical inhibitory loop: involve the granule cells, and the purkinje that in turn will inhibit the deep cerebellar nuc.

Neuropsychology: The brain and behaviour:
The student shall:
 
1)Be able to explain how neural regulation mechanisms, cognitive processes and behaviour aim to preserve shortterm and long-term homeostasis of the body’s systems(S2, S3).
 
2)Be able to describe the functions of cognitive processes (for example emotion, memory, 
language) and connect these with underlying neural structures (S2, S3).
 
Emotion	Emotion (Ie some variable K) can either be an innate or a learned response to external or internal stimuli. The three conditions of emotion:
	Behaviour (facial expression, approach/avert)
	Physiology (ANS response)
	Cognition (subj exp)
 
Great divergence in the scientific community regardin research looking at emotion, where the subjective or the cognitive aspect of the emotion becomes central, as is the case with "fear" research. It is critical to note that the subjective experience of an external stimulus, can elicit a cognitive response, that has nothing to do with the underlying physiological or behavrioural mechanisms, and vice versa. 
Contextual conditioning	The contextual stimulus goes through the hippocampus, then goes to the BA, then to the central region before being sent to the brainstem eliciting the reaction to the CS. The contextual data is saved not in the amygdala but in the hippocampus that then comms with the amygdala. 
 
Memory	Two main kinds of memory
Working memory	 
Long-term memory	 
Non-declarative		Procedural
	Perceptual representation
	Conditioning
Declarative		Semantic
	Episodic
 
Language
The forntal and the temporal lobes are involved in language procesisng. There are two different areas of interest. We seem to be talking about the left side when we regard language and the temporal lobe. 
 
	Wernicke's area (temporal lobe (laterally)): Is seemingly involved with understanding and interpreting language. Lesions here leads to patients not being able to 
	Broca's area (frontal lobe laterally): expression and formulating words and sentences, and produce sounds all forms of language included. 
 
On the other hand the abovementioned areas aof Wernicke and Broca areas are instead involved with introducing emotional content to the words (e.g. uttering something with fervour, or with sadness etc.)
